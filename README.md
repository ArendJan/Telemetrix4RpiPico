The Telemetrix4RpiPico server, in conjunction with its [client peer](https://github.com/MrYsLab/telemetrix-rpi-pico),
allows you to control a Raspberry Pi Pico remotely from your
PC. A complete [User's Guide](https://mryslab.github.io/telemetrix-rpi-pico/) is available describing how to 
install and use both the server and client.

To install the server, follow these [installation instructions.](https://mryslab.github.io/telemetrix-rpi-pico/install_pico_server/)
